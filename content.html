          <h3>3.1 Backing up of data</h3>
          <p>
            This chapter covers many forms of <em>secondary storage</em> and compares the
            advantages and disadvantages of each type. In Chapter 1, you learnt
            about the primary memory, known as RAM and ROM. We will consider a
            number of storage devices later but first it is important to
            consider why we need to back up data using these devices and also
            how data is accessed.
          </p>
          <h3>3.1.1 What is backing up of data?</h3>
          <p>
            <em>Backing up</em> refers to the copying of files/data to a different medium
            (disk, tape, flash drive, etc.) in case of a problem with the main
            secondary storage device. Backing up files and data on a regular
            basis is seen as good computing practice and many computer systems
            can be set to back up files automatically on a regular basis. An
            example would be the use of magnetic tapes to back up internet
            servers on a regular basis, or cloud storage companies using
            magnetic tape or hard disk drives to back up clients' data on a
            regular basis. The backups are often stored in a different place to
            the main storage. This is in case of fire or some other situation
            that could lead to irretrievable loss of key data/files.
          </p>
          <h3>3.1.2 Why back up data?</h3>
          <p>
            There are various reasons why backups are made. Some of the more
            common reasons are considered below:
            <ul style="padding-left: 5rem;">
              <li style="font-size: 15px;">To safeguard against loss of data due to the failure of the
            original secondary storage device; this could be due to hardware
            failure (e.g. head crash on a hard drive unit), problems caused by
            files being overwritten accidentally (or otherwise) or possible
            corruption of files (for example, caused by power surges).</li> 
            <li style="font-size: 15px;">To safeguard against damage caused by hackers. This may not be their
            intention (they may only want to gain access to the information for
            other purposes, for example to find personal information such as
            bank account details). However, the very act of hacking in to files
            could cause problems such as corruption or data loss.
            Backups are also made in case the files need to be used elsewhere;
            this protects the originals against possible corruption or loss. </li>
            <li style="font-size: 15px;">Backups don't necessarily guard against the effect of a
            virus. The virus could attach itself to the files, which could mean
            that the backups are also affected. If the computer was 'cleaned' of
            the virus and then the backup files reloaded, there is a real risk
            that the virus could infect the computer system again. The best
            protection is not to get a virus in the first place.</li>
          </p>
