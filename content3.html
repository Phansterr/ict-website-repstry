                <h3>3.2.1 Serial access (continued)</h3>
                <p>
                    When the original magnetic tape (called a <em>master file</em>) needs <em>updating</em>, an additional tape (called a <em>transaction file</em>)
                    is required. The transaction file contains all the new data to allow the master file
                    to be updated (although the transaction file is very often another tape, the new
                    data could in fact be stored on a different medium). The updated tape is referred
                    to as the new master file. When using tapes, it is essential that the records on both
                    master file and transaction file are sorted in the same order (for example, sorted by
                    customer number if it is a billing application - the field used to sort the records is
                    often referred to as a <em>key field</em>).
                    This is an example of how a master file (MF) can be updated using a
                    Transaction File (TF). The scenario here is a book shop that sells books. All of
                    the books held in stock are stored on the MF in ISBN order-the ISBN acts as
                    the key field for each record (each different book title will have its own record
                    made
                    up of the ISBN, title of book, author, genre, cost price and selling price).
                    All the changes during the day will be stored on the TF - if a book sells, if new
                    books come in, if a book is out of print, and so on. At the end of each day, the MF is updated, using
                    the new data stored on the TF. The basic steps in the update process are shown below:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul style="padding-left: 5rem;">
                        <li style="font-size: 15px;">At the end of the day, the TF is sorted in the same order
                        as the MF (this will be done using the ISBN which is known here as the key field).</li>
                        <li style="font-size: 15px;">A new master file (NMF) is created to store the updated records of the books
                        in the first shop.</li>
                        <li style="font-size: 15px;">The first record in the TF is then read and the first record in the MF
                        is also read. </li><ul style="padding-left: 3rem;">
                            <li style="font-size: 15px;">The two records are compared with each other.</li>
                            <li style="font-size: 15px;">If the key field on the MF < the key field on the TF, then no transactions
                            took place and the MF record is written to the NMF; a new MF record is now read.</li>
                            <li style="font-size: 15px;">If the key field on the MF = the key field on the TF, then a transaction
                            took place and the new record from the TF is written to the NMF; the next record from both the MF and TF are now read.</li>
                            <li style="font-size: 15px;">If the transaction file indicates a deletion then the record
                            is simply not written to the NMF and a new record from each file is read.</li>
                            <li style="font-size: 15px;">If the key field on the MF is greater than the key field on the TF, then
                            the record doesn't yet exist and a new record is created on the NMF and the record is written from the TF to
                            the NMF; a new TF record is now read.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li style="font-size: 15px;">The process is repeated until the end of the MF.</li>
                        <li style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, any remaining records on the TF are written to the NMF.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
